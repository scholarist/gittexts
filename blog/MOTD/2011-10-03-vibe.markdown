[Vibe][1] is a secure and anonymous Twitter alternative
prefered by the [Occupy Wallstreet protesters][2]:

> Currently available in the Apple App Store, Vibe is similar to Twitter
> in several ways. It encourages short messages shared with your network,
> replies back and forth, and it’s made to be mobile.

> However, it is also an anonymous network, with each message sent without
> a username or identification.

> Users send out a message on Vibe, and select whether to “whisper” it,
> meaning to send it to only a small geographical area surrounding them,
> or “shout” to the entire network.

> It’s the geographical and anonymous nature of Vibe that Beta Beat says
> is so attractive to protesters at the #OccupyWallstreet protests
> happening right now in the heart of New York city.
