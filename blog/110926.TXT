Genealogy

John Costigan was born 1822 in County Kilkenny, Ireland. Costigan still seems to be a common name in the areas. In 1842, his son, James, is born. The two show up in a plat map of Harmony Township, Rock County, Wisconsin, dated 1867. They own farms on either side of Henke Road, near Spalding's Pond. This is about a mile and a half from the land farmed by William Costigan some 45 years later. 

Both James and John, and their families are buried in Moun Olivet Cemetary, Janesville. John outlived his son, living until 1907. 

I can find no mention of William's birth and the first actually trace I can find is a 1920 plat showing his farm at its current location. Presumably he is James' son. One of his sisters (Margaret? I forget.) married a man named Hayes and they had a son named Phillip in 1901. Phil was Charlotte Costigan's first cousin and I remember visiting him in his home on Lake Koshkonong after he retired. Phil participated in the GM sit-down strike in the winter of 1937. It was a brutal time and he never had anything good to say about GM after that.

William was born in 1879 and died in 1952. He married Mary Pierce (died 1943) and had two children who survived infancy, Charlotte and Gerald.

Merritt Welch was born in 1827 in Quebec, Canada. He emigrated to the US, moved to Iowa, and married a woman named Rachel (last name unknown). Merritt's origin is listed in the census as Canadian (English). Irwin Claire Welch was born in Iowa in 1857 and he died in 1942. He married Margaret Black and they had four sons who survived childhood, including Chester Claire Welch (1889-1967), born in Omaha. Other brothers included Walter and Otto.
