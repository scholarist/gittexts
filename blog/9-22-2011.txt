Last day of summer 2011. Since I had cancer six years ago I've loved summer,=
 when I'm never cold. I love the long days and the humidity, and ai don't ca=
re for the whining I hear when it's too warm. The solstice is a sad time--th=
e days are never going to be longer than they are. Already we've lost an hou=
r or more of sun in the evening and as much again in the morning. The other n=
ight I smelled that first scent of fall, even though it was a warm evening. R=
otting leaves carried on the breeze, which is the first marker of the changi=
ng season.
