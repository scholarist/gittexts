
The [Occupy Wallstreet][OW] protests are spreading; [Daily Kos][DK]
lists over 200 events, including one in Madison, and [Occupy
Together][OT] is serving as an internet clearing house.

Many of the local events rely on Facebook to host their web presence.
[Winer][DW], argues that the groups should rely instead on RSS, which
comes free with every blog host out there--Tumblr, Wordpress, and
LiveJournal are three good choices. Some people still don't pay much
attention to the 'borg; and, after all, its good policy to diversify
your news feeds by reposting the Facebook material elsewhere. As Dave
says,:

> Facebook is the equivalent of Wall Street in the tech world. So it's
> important that you communicate not just with people inside Facebook, but
> those outside as well.

Kids, friends don't let friends use Facebook.
