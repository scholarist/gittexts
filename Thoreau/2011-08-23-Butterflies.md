Read a notice from the Journal for 6.2.1855. Thoreau had harvested a
butterfly cocoon from the forest and pinned it on a window sill in his
room after a walk on 5.24.1855. He forgot about it until Sophia called
to tell him there was a moth in his room. They watched it emerge from
the cocoon for several hours. When the butterfly was fully dried,
Thoreau admired it for a few minutes and then "gave it some ether",
preserving a perfect specimen.

Here the emergence of a butterfly is nothing but an occasion for
objective observation and specimen collecting. I had expected some pay
off at the end of this length notices, some oblique observation about his
Concord neighbors, or at least the eventual return of the butterfly to
the wild. Thoreau confounds expectations here, and killing the specimen
reminds me that this is a working journal notice, not a _pensee_.
Whether he would have made use of this notice later is hard to say.
After reading this unsentimental text I'd be disappointed if a reworked
note tried to find some greater significance in the death of a moth on
the window sill.
