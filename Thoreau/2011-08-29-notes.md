In the *Walden* chapter on the ponds, HDT talks about the purity of
Walden and its associated White Pond. He thinks of both as pristine,
clear, pure, and at one point calls them "lakes of light".

There is so much packed into that paragraph, its hard to take it apart. 

Contrast with the neighboring Flint pond, soiled by being named after a
skinflint old farmer who only saw his harvest ripen when it was
converted into dollars. 

The entire chapter is about ways that nature does not cooperate with
nature's purpose. It doesn't have value, and it yields nothing very
useful, as in the episode of the tree trunk that was resting upside down
in the middle of the pond.  

Themes include the market, what people value, nature, etc. It really
bears rereading.
