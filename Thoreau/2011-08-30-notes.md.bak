*Baker Farm*. HDT talks about the trees in the neighborhood, listing
them by name, and ending by calling them "shrines". The chapter changes
tack during a rainstorm, when he finds cover in what he at first thinks
is an abandoned hut. He meets the Flynn family, poor Irish, supported by
father John's work as a bogger, who earns 10 dollars an acre for digging
up meadowland. 

Thoreau thinks he's getting the short end of the deal as this work will
cost him much more than 10 bucks a month. 

I think some of the costs may be real--bogging is hard work and wears
out heavy boots and clothing. Other costs, certainly, are the neglected
opportunities Flynn and his family will miss by trying to pursue wealth
the old -fashioned way, through hard and meaningless work that limits
freedom. He notes Mrs. Flynn, saying she still thinks she can improve
her life.

I detect a condesenscion to the poor Irish here and I probably reacted
to it when I last read *Walden* about 10 years ago. HDT was blaming the
poor for their problems. Of course I had no problem when HDT blames the
bourgeoisie for *their* problems, because somehow I see the poor as
different, with fewer resources to help themselves. This is equally
condescending, of course, treating the poor as helpless. 

Regardless of the cause of the poverty, the proper interpretation seems
to be that anyone has agency, that anyone can do things to improve their
life and escape poverty. Not by making more money, of course, but by
living simply. When you redefine poverty as the lack of things that are
really important in life, you can escape it this way.

Of course, this kind of secular renunciation is quietist. That's another
argument.
