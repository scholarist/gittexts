Update

This is an experiment in public writing using git. Instead
of a blog or a website, I'm using Github, mostly without the nice bloggy
add-ons that the service provides.

Anyone can read this material; just clone the repository. Add a tracking
branch for updates. If you want to comment, just fork the repo and then
issue a pull request ;).

This is a repository for maintaining and backing up texts from my web
writings. Some of them will show up at [scholarist.net](http://www.scholarist.net).
