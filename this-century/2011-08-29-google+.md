In the end Google+ will have to scrap the name policy and use the sort

More from [Nym Wars][nw]: John Paul Stevens in an opinion once wrote:
"Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. It thus
exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of rights, and of the First
Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from
retalians...at the hand of an intolerant society". 

Real identity is not important--*persistant identify* is important.
