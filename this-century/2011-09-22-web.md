Joe Hewitt, "Web Technologies Need an Owner" _[Link][lnk]_

[lnk]: http://is.gd/vzXtdb

When you read randomly and widely, you find articles that clarify your
thinking. I'd heard about the "web as a platform", but I was never sure
what it meant. Hewitt simplifies it, perhaps too much, to html, css, and
Javascript. Any web application is going to use those three tools. The
web is open, free, and leaderless because these three tools are widely
available.

Fundamentally, Hewitt thinks this is a flaw. The ownerless web can't
innovate quickly enough to keep up with proprietary internet
applications designed for mobile phones and tablets. Eventually
FaceBorg and all the rest will be accessed from proprietary apps, and the
web version of the services, if they exist at all, will be vestigial. The
web will go back to being a large repository of hyperlinked documents,
sort of Gopher with pictures.
