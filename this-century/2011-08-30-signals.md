Google has been using the word "signal" a lot. Schmidt used it in his
explanation of Google+ as an identity server, and a *Wired* piece
contains a quote from a Google spokesperson email describing +1 button
hits as "ranking signals". 

Later in the *Wired* piece, the spokesman says that Google uses '200
signals' in its search algorithm.
