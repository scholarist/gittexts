While I was complaining earlier about the amount of work it takes to
read a book lately, with the way I reflect and take notes, I have to
remind myself that I've chosen this life freely, because I admire it.
Many people read a lot more than I do and certainly don't find it
burdensome. My practice may be a little different in detail but is the
same in essence.
