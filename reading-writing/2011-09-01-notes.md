September 1 2011

I think best when I'm reading and sometimes I think only when I'm
reading. Often what I think is nothing more than a mush of sensations,
with occasional lucid phrases bubbling to the top. Perhaps I'm
considering what I read, mulling it over, composting it. Its hard for me
to believe I can have an original idea while I'm sitting on a chair
without a book or a piece of paper.

Especially with a text like Thoreau, Montaigne, or Burton, I'm
constantly responding and writing down notes and quotations for use
later. The purpose of the thinking is to write something later on the
text before me. I'm a blogger and a diarist whose topic is the interplay
between the text and my consciousness. In other words, I'm writing on
my responses to texts. Like Thoreau, who wrote of his responses to
nature. 

The writers I chose are encouraging. Montaigne and Burton are responding
to the texts they themselves read, while Thoreau responds to a more
complex set of stimuli, including texts, fellow citizens of Concord,
and his own obscurely glimpsed "higher truth". 

This makes me seem very bookish.
