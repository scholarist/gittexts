I wish my mental attic to be cleaner and more spartan. Now its
overloaded and crowded with fighting ideas so thick that I can't tell
them apart. Phrases repeat themselves and bubble to the top, and that
perhaps is the most coherent part of my mental life.  When I read, its
different, though.I have coherent reactions to whatever I'm reading,
coherent enough that I write them out in sentences. 

I wish I could save the stewing until I sit down to read or write. I
wish I wasn't always stumbling over old furniture and trunks, and
stopped talking to myself as I negotiate the attic.
