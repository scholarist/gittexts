##Writing

Why write? Why keep a commonplace or a journal? Because you want to
construct a self who writes.

Donald Frame on Montaigne: 

> Self-sufficient though he was, he had an imperious need to
> communicate. The _Essais_ are his means of communication; the reader
> takes the place of the dead friend.

Keeping a journal or a commonplace is just another way of communicating.
The process allows you entry into the world where writers write, where
words and ideas are moved around on a page and where you can build up a
substantial body of work simply by applying yourself repeatedly. 
There
is a low barrier to entry, unless you wish to publish, but publication is
something completely different from writing, isn't it?
