The problem with internet writing is not that it never ends, but that it is done for no clear end. The blogging form and the rules of SEO require almost daily updates, whether or not the writer has something to say. The writer goes looking for "content", which is usually a second hand thought coupled with a snappy comment. Often its even a simple link that anyone could find on Google or an RSS reader. You do it today, you do it tomorrow and next week, with no end in sight. People don't write blogs, they serve them. The blog is the author and makes the blogger the subject.
